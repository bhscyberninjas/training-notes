#### What is Linux?

Linux is a free, open-source operating system that behaves similarly to UNIX. It offers a free, hackable, tinker-friendly alternative to commercial operating systems like Windows or Mac OSX.

#### Where did Linux come from?

Linux was written by Linus Torvalds, who originally intended it to be a hobby, and did not expect it to take off. The first version of Linux was released in 1994.

#### How is Linux maintained?

Linux is a free, open-source software product. It is still managed by Linus Torvalds and his Linux Foundation, but it is contributed to by many people all around the world. Open source means that anyone can view/change the code, so Linux is a very flexible OS.
