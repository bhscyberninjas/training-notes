## Free Servers

If you don't have an Ubuntu virtual machine ready on your laptop to follow along with, I have 5 VMs you can borrow. Each team gets 1 VM unless there are extras.

You must use PuTTY, which can be downloaded and installed from the link above. When you open PuTTY, connect to ``k4kfh.asuscomm.com`` using the port that corresponds to the VM you want (#1-5). See screenshot below for example:

Once you have that entered, click "Open." PuTTY will pop up a warning saying it doesn't recognize the host, so click "Okay" and move on as shown below.

Now it should leave you at a login screen. Log in with username ``cyberpatriot`` and password ``cyberninja``. There may be some waiting, but that's normal.

_Remember that it won't show your password as you type it, so just type and press enter._

**If all goes well, you should eventually be dropped to a Linux command line, like so:**

_Note the red lines where the username and password are typed_
